/**
 * Downloads a newer release and installs it over the JAR this server is running from.
 *
 * ## Why this is written defensively
 *
 * This is the one component that installs code. Everything it fetches is remote and therefore
 * attacker-influenceable, so the download is treated as hostile until proven otherwise:
 *
 *  - **The SHA-256 digest published by the GitHub API is mandatory and verified before anything is
 *    installed.** A byte that does not hash to the expected digest is never swapped in.
 *  - **Redirects are followed manually**, one hop at a time, and every hop must be HTTPS on a
 *    GitHub-owned host ([UpdateChecker.isAllowedDownloadUrl]). GitHub serves release binaries via a
 *    redirect to its CDN, so redirects cannot simply be disabled — but they must not be able to
 *    steer the download to an arbitrary host.
 *  - **No credentials are ever sent.** The Defender credentials must never leave Microsoft hosts, and the
 *    releases endpoint is public, so this uses its own unauthenticated client.
 *  - **The payload must be a real JAR** containing this server's entry point before it replaces
 *    anything, so a valid-hash-but-wrong-artifact swap cannot brick the install.
 *  - **Nothing throws.** Every failure degrades to an [Outcome] describing what happened.
 *
 * ## Residual risk (deliberately documented, not solved here)
 *
 * The digest is fetched from the same GitHub API response that advertises the download. That
 * defends against a corrupted or tampered *download* (CDN compromise, an interception of the asset
 * fetch, truncation), but **not** against an attacker who controls the GitHub release itself — a
 * repository or account compromise would serve a matching digest for malicious bytes. Defending
 * against that requires signature verification against a pinned public key, which this project does
 * not yet publish. Operators who cannot accept that residual risk should disable automatic
 * installation ([Config.ENV_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE] or `--no-auto-update`) and update manually.

/**
 * Caps how many MCP [Server]s the `--http` transport keeps alive, closing the oldest when a new one
 * would pass [maxLive].
 *
 * Both HTTP transports build a Server for every session: Streamable HTTP for every POST that carries
 * no `Mcp-Session-Id`, the legacy transport for every event stream. The SDK forgets a Streamable
 * HTTP session only when the client sends DELETE, and most clients simply exit, so a long-running
 * `--http` server kept one Server per reconnect for the rest of its life.
 *
 * A limit that refused new sessions would turn those abandoned ones into a permanent lock-out, and
 * the SDK exposes no idle time to expire them by. Closing the oldest instead bounds memory and keeps
 * the server open to new clients. Closing a Server closes its session and the SDK forgets its id, so
 * a client that does come back with it gets 404, which the Streamable HTTP specification answers by
 * initializing again; a legacy client sees its event stream end.
 *
 * A Server whose session ends (a DELETE, or a legacy stream the server sees end) leaves the count at
 * once. Everything else stays counted until it is evicted, which is the bound this class exists to
 * keep: a client that never finished initializing, and a legacy client that dropped its stream, since
 * Ktor's CIO engine does not notice a client leaving a stream nothing is being written to.
 *
 * A Server whose session never initialized is evicted before any that did. The SDK builds one for
 * every sessionless POST before it reads the body, so a probe or a buggy client posting anything but
 * `initialize` gets a Server too, answered 400 and never registered; counted like a live session, each
 * one past the cap closed the oldest real client. Among the uninitialized, the oldest goes first — a
 * real client is uninitialized only for its handshake — and the newcomer itself is never its own victim.

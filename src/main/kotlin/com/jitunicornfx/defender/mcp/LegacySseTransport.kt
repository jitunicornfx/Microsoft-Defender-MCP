/** How long a legacy stream's end waits for its Server to close. */
private const val CLOSE_TIMEOUT_MILLIS = 1_000L

/**
 * The legacy HTTP+SSE transport (GET [path] opens the event stream, POST [path]?sessionId=… carries
 * client messages), mounted so that it works for every client.
 *
 * The SDK's own `Route.mcp(path)` announces a *relative* endpoint (`?sessionId=…`). Browsers and the
 * TypeScript SDK resolve that against the stream URL (→ `/sse?sessionId=…`), but the Kotlin SDK client
 * resolves it against the stream URL's parent (→ `/?sessionId=…`), which 404s. Announcing the absolute
 * path removes the ambiguity. Otherwise this mirrors the SDK helper: one [Server] per connection, a
 * session map keyed by the transport's session id, entries removed when the server closes.
 *
 * The stream and its Server end together. The SDK helper waits for cancellation alone, so a Server
 * closed from outside (the `--http` session cap, [ServerGovernor]) left its stream handler suspended
 * and the Server reachable from it; here the stream ends, and the client sees it end. The other way
 * round, a stream that ends (the handler is cancelled) closes its Server, which the cap then stops
 * counting. Ktor does not cancel it when a client silently drops an idle stream, which is why the
 * cap, not this, is what bounds such Servers.
 *
 * Requires the Ktor `SSE` plugin to be installed (done by `mcpStreamableHttp`).

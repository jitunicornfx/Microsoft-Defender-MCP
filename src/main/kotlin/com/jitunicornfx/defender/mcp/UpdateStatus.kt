/**
 * What this process knows about updates, kept so `defender_server_info` can answer from it.
 *
 * The update notices are pushes, and a push is best-effort: over Streamable HTTP a message the server
 * sends while the client has no event stream open is dropped, not queued, and a client that never
 * opens one never gets it. The server info tool is a request the client makes, so this is the
 * authoritative answer and the notices are a courtesy.
 *
 * Process-wide, like [ResultBudget] and [SpoolStore]: `--http` builds a Server per session, but there
 * is one startup check and at most one install attempt per process. It holds no `Deferred` and
 * nothing here suspends, so a tool handler reading [active] can never wait on a check in flight.
